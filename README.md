# minesweeper
Minesweeper is a classic computer reasoning game where the user must reveal all the squares without accidentally uncovering a mine. Each square can have a number from zero to eight, representing the number of bombs in the eight adjacent squares. Revealing an empty square with a zero also unlocks adjacent squares with zeros.

This game was originally introduced in 1989, initially programmed in C. The objective of this project is to simulate the gameâ€™s functionality by implementing classes (i.e., adapting C++ functionalities in video game development) and a history system, including a basic automatic player.

This program was developed as my final project for the Programming 2 course at UTEC. Please note that the program is entirely in Spanish.
